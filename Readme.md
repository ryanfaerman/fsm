FSM provides a lightweight finite state machine for Golang. It runs allows any number of transition checks you'd like the it runs them in parallel. It's tested and benchmarked too.

## Install

```
go get github.com/ryanfaerman/fsm
```

## Usage

```go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/ryanfaerman/fsm"
)

type Thing struct {
	State fsm.State

	// our machine cache
	machine *fsm.Machine
}

// Add methods to comply with the fsm.Stater interface
func (t *Thing) CurrentState() fsm.State { return t.State }
func (t *Thing) SetState(s fsm.State)    { t.State = s }

// A helpful function that lets us apply arbitrary rulesets to this
// instances state machine without reallocating the machine. While not
// required, it's something I like to have.
func (t *Thing) Apply(r *fsm.Ruleset) *fsm.Machine {
	if t.machine == nil {
		t.machine = &fsm.Machine{Subject: t}
	}

	t.machine.Rules = r
	return t.machine
}

func main() {
	var err error

	some_thing := Thing{State: "pending"} // Our subject

	// Establish some rules for our FSM
	rules := fsm.Ruleset{}
	rules.AddTransition(fsm.T{"pending", "started"})
	rules.AddTransition(fsm.T{"started", "finished"})

	machine := some_thing.Apply(&rules)

	err = machine.Transition("started")

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(some_thing.CurrentState())
}

```

*Note:* FSM makes no effort to determine the default state for any ruleset. That's your job.

The `Apply(r *fsm.Ruleset) *fsm.Machine` method is absolutely optional. I like having it though. It solves a pretty common problem I usually have when working with permissions - some users aren't allowed to transition between certain states.

Since the rules are applied to the the subject (through the machine) I can have a simple lookup to determine the ruleset that the subject has to follow for a given user. As a result, I rarely need to use any complicated guards but I can if need be. I leave the lookup and the maintaining of independent rulesets as an exercise of the user.

## Benchmarks
Golang makes it easy enough to benchmark things... why not do a few general benchmarks?

```shell
$ go test -bench=.
PASS
BenchmarkRulesetParallelGuarding      100000   13163 ns/op
BenchmarkRulesetTransitionPermitted  1000000    1805 ns/op
BenchmarkRulesetTransitionDenied    10000000     284 ns/op
BenchmarkRulesetRuleForbids          1000000    1717 ns/op
ok    github.com/ryanfaerman/fsm 14.864s
```

I think that's pretty good. So why do I go through the trouble of running the guards in parallel? Consider the benchmarks below:

```shell
$ go test -bench=.
PASS
BenchmarkRulesetParallelGuarding    100000       13261 ns/op
ok  github.com/ryanfaerman/fsm 1.525s


$ go test -bench=.
PASS
BenchmarkRulesetSerialGuarding         1  1003140956 ns/op
ok  github.com/ryanfaerman/fsm 1.007s
```

For the Parallel vs Serial benchmarks I had a guard that slept for 1 second. While I don't imagine most guards will take that long, the point remains true. Some guards will be comparatively slow -- they'll be accessing the database or consulting with some other outside service -- and why not get an answer back as soon as possible?
